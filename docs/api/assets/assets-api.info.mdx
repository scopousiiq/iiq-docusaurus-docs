The Assets API provides full access to IncidentIQ's asset management system. Track devices, equipment, and inventory throughout their lifecycle—from procurement to retirement.

## Overview

Assets in IncidentIQ represent physical or digital items your organization manages: laptops, Chromebooks, tablets, printers, projectors, and more.

:::info
**What you can do with the Assets API**

- **Search and inventory** assets by model, location, status, or assigned user
- **Track asset lifecycle** from purchase through deployment, repair, and retirement
- **Manage assignments** to users, locations, or storage areas
- **Record costs** including purchase price, repairs, and total cost of ownership
- **Handle checkout/check-in** for loaner devices and shared equipment
- **Link assets to tickets** for repair tracking and history
:::

## Common Use Cases

### Device Onboarding
Automatically create asset records when devices are enrolled in MDM systems like Google Admin, Jamf, or Intune.

### Inventory Sync
Keep asset data synchronized with external inventory systems, ERPs, or procurement platforms.

### Assignment Automation
Automatically assign devices to users based on student information system (SIS) data or HR feeds.

### Audit and Compliance
Generate asset reports for E-Rate audits, insurance claims, or compliance requirements.

### Repair Tracking
Link assets to repair tickets and track total repair costs over the device lifecycle.

## Quick Start

**cURL
**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-site.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0/assets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "SiteId: YOUR_SITE_ID" \
  -H "Client: ApiClient" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "Filters": [
      {"Facet": "ModelName", "Values": ["Chromebook 3100"]}
    ],
    "Paging": {"PageSize": 50, "PageIndex": 0}
  }'
```

**JavaScript
**

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://your-site.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0/assets', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
    'SiteId': 'YOUR_SITE_ID',
    'Client': 'ApiClient',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    Filters: [
      { Facet: 'ModelName', Values: ['Chromebook 3100'] }
    ],
    Paging: { PageSize: 50, PageIndex: 0 }
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.Items);
```

**Python
**

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://your-site.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0/assets',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
        'SiteId': 'YOUR_SITE_ID',
        'Client': 'ApiClient',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        'Filters': [
            {'Facet': 'ModelName', 'Values': ['Chromebook 3100']}
        ],
        'Paging': {'PageSize': 50, 'PageIndex': 0}
    }
)

data = response.json()
print(data['Items'])
```

### Get Asset Details

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-site.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0/assets/{assetId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "SiteId: YOUR_SITE_ID" \
  -H "Client: ApiClient"
```

### Checkout an Asset

:::warning
**Checkout Requirements**

The asset must be in a status that allows checkout (typically "In Storage" or "Available"). The user must exist in the system.
:::

```json http
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://your-site.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0/assets/{assetId}/checkout",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN",
    "SiteId": "YOUR_SITE_ID",
    "Client": "ApiClient",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "UserId": "USER_UUID",
    "ExpectedReturnDate": "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Key Concepts

:::info
**Asset Status Types**

Assets have status types that indicate their current state: Deployed, In Storage, In Repair, Retired, etc. Use the status type endpoints to retrieve available statuses for your site.
:::

### Serial Numbers and Asset Tags
Assets are typically identified by serial number (manufacturer-assigned) and asset tag (organization-assigned). Both can be used for searching and lookups.

### Owner vs. Location
An asset's **Owner** is the user it's assigned to. The **Location** is where the asset physically resides. These can differ—for example, a laptop assigned to a student (owner) at a specific school (location).
