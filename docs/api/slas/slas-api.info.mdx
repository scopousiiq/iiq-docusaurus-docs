The SLAs API provides access to Service Level Agreement definitions and tracking in IncidentIQ. Monitor response times, resolution times, and compliance rates across your help desk.

## Overview

SLAs (Service Level Agreements) define response and resolution time expectations for tickets. They help ensure timely service, drive accountability, and provide metrics for performance tracking and reporting.

:::info
**What you can do with the SLAs API**
:::

>
> - **Retrieve SLA definitions** and their time-based rules
> - **Access SLA metrics** for performance monitoring and dashboards
> - **Understand SLA rules** applied to tickets based on priority, category, or location
> - **Track compliance rates** for reporting and continuous improvement

## Common Use Cases

### SLA Monitoring Dashboards
Build real-time dashboards showing SLA compliance rates, at-risk tickets, and breached tickets that need immediate attention.

### Escalation Triggers
Identify tickets approaching SLA deadlines for proactive escalation. Trigger notifications or reassignments before breaches occur.

### Performance Reporting
Generate weekly or monthly reports on SLA attainment for stakeholders, broken down by team, location, or category.

### Capacity Planning
Analyze SLA data to identify patterns—peak times, problem categories, or understaffed locations—to improve resource allocation.

## API Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Definitions** | SLA rule configurations and time thresholds |
| **Metrics** | SLA performance data and compliance statistics |

## Quick Start

### List SLA Definitions

**cURL
**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-site.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0/slas" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "SiteId: YOUR_SITE_ID" \
  -H "Client: ApiClient"
```

**JavaScript
**

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://your-site.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0/slas', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
    'SiteId': 'YOUR_SITE_ID',
    'Client': 'ApiClient'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
// Returns SLA definitions with response/resolution time thresholds
console.log(data.Items);
```

**Python
**

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://your-site.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0/slas',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
        'SiteId': 'YOUR_SITE_ID',
        'Client': 'ApiClient'
    }
)

data = response.json()
# Returns SLA definitions with response/resolution time thresholds
print(data['Items'])
```

## Key Concepts

:::info
**SLA Time Types**
:::

>
> SLAs typically track two time metrics:
> - **Response Time** — How quickly an agent first responds to a ticket
> - **Resolution Time** — How long until the ticket is fully resolved

### SLA Timer States

SLA timers don't run continuously—they respond to ticket status:

| Timer State | When | Example Statuses |
|-------------|------|------------------|
| **Running** | Ticket is active and awaiting action | New, Assigned, In Progress |
| **Paused** | Waiting on external factors | Waiting for User, Waiting for Parts |
| **Stopped** | Ticket completed | Resolved, Closed |

### Business Hours

SLA timers typically only count **business hours**, not calendar time. A ticket created Friday at 4 PM with a 4-hour SLA may not breach until Monday morning, depending on your business hours configuration.

:::warning
**Business Hours Configuration**
:::

>
> SLA calculations depend on your site's business hours settings. Ensure business hours and holidays are configured correctly for accurate SLA tracking.

### SLA Rules and Matching

SLAs can be configured to apply based on various criteria:

- **Priority** — High-priority tickets get shorter SLA windows
- **Category** — Hardware issues might have different SLAs than software requests
- **Location** — Remote sites might have extended SLA windows
- **Issue Type** — Critical issues like "System Down" get aggressive SLAs

When a ticket matches multiple SLA rules, the most specific (or most restrictive) rule typically applies.

### SLA Breach Levels

Many organizations track multiple breach levels:

- **Warning** — Approaching deadline (e.g., 75% of time elapsed)
- **Breached** — Deadline passed
- **Severely Breached** — Significantly past deadline (e.g., 2x the SLA time)

### Checking SLA Status on Tickets

Ticket responses include SLA information showing current status and time remaining:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-site.incidentiq.com/api/v1.0/tickets/{ticketId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "SiteId: YOUR_SITE_ID" \
  -H "Client: ApiClient"
```

The response includes SLA fields like `ResponseSlaStatus`, `ResolutionSlaStatus`, and time remaining until breach.
