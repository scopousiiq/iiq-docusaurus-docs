# Inventory API

The Inventory API provides access to IncidentIQ's inventory management system. Track consumable items, parts, and supplies across locations with full support for stock actions, catalogs, and usage reporting.

## Overview

Inventory in IncidentIQ represents consumable items and supplies that your organization manages separately from fixed assets—items like replacement cables, printer cartridges, repair parts, and office supplies.
