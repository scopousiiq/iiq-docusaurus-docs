The Tickets API provides comprehensive access to IncidentIQ's ticketing system. Create, search, update, and manage help desk tickets programmatically, including workflow transitions, assignments, comments, and attachments.

## Overview

Tickets are the core of IncidentIQ's service management platform. Each ticket represents a request for help, an incident, or a task that needs to be tracked and resolved.

:::info
**What you can do with the Tickets API**

- **Search and filter** tickets by status, assignee, location, category, or custom criteria
- **Create tickets** programmatically from external systems, forms, or automation rules
- **Update ticket details** including status, priority, custom fields, and assignments
- **Manage workflow transitions** to move tickets through your defined processes
- **Handle communications** via comments, notes, and notifications
- **Work with subtasks** to break down complex tickets into manageable pieces
:::

## Common Use Cases

### Help Desk Integration
Sync tickets bidirectionally with external ITSM platforms, ensuring your team works in their preferred tools while maintaining a single source of truth.

### Automated Ticket Creation
Create tickets automatically from monitoring systems, email parsers, or IoT device alerts without manual intervention.

### Custom Reporting
Build dashboards that pull ticket data in real-time, enabling custom KPI tracking beyond built-in reports.

### Workflow Automation
Trigger external actions when tickets reach specific workflow steps, such as notifying facilities, ordering parts, or updating asset records.
